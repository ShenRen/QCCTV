# QCCTV

QCCTV allows you to use your devices (computers, mobile phones, tablets, etc.) as security/CCTV cameras.

Besides security, QCCTV can have many uses, such as recording a video with multiple cameras at once or check that your kitchen is not burning while you are using your computer upstairs. 

The QCCTV suite consists of two applications:

- QCCTV Camera, which streams your camera's live images to the LAN
- QCCTV Station, which receives camera streams from the LAN and manages each camera individually

### The QCCTV Camera

You can use your device as a security camera by installing and running *QCCTV Camera* on it. The application will automatically connect and stream to any QCCTV Station running on your LAN.

### The QCCTV Station

The QCCTV Station allows you to connect and control any device running the QCCTV Camera in your LAN.

Ideally, you should only have one running instance of the QCCTV Station in all your LAN.

### License

The QCCTV software suite is released under the MIT license.
